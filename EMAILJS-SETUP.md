## Step 5: Update the Code

Open `js/main.js` and replace these placeholders:

emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");

// Lines ~190-191: Replace with your actual IDs
await emailjs.send(
    "YOUR_SERVICE_ID",     // Replace with your Service ID
    "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID",    // Replace with your Template ID
    {
        // ... rest of the code
    }
);
```

## Example Configuration

Here's what your code should look like after setup:

```javascript
// Initialize EmailJS
emailjs.init("user_abc123def456"); // Your actual public key

// In the form submission handler
await emailjs.send(
    "service_gmail123",    // Your actual service ID
    "template_contact456", // Your actual template ID
    {
        from_name: formData.name,
        from_email: formData.email,
        subject: formData.subject,
        message: formData.message,
        to_name: "Darren Freimuth"
    }
);
```

## Step 6: Test Your Form

2. Refresh your website
3. Fill out the contact form
4. Check your email for the message
5. Check the browser console for any errors
